Hi! My name is **Matheus Henrique Bonetti**, I am a digital designer living in the beautiful Florian√≥polis island, in Brazil.

From websites to softwares, I am experienced in almost every development phase of digital products. I can design user experiences (**UX**), prototype user interfaces (**UI**) and implement my design work through **HTML/CSS** and some **Javascript** and front-end development knowledge. I am also proficient in understating **web analytics** data, doing **user interviews** and **usability tests**, crafting and validating **optimization hypothesis** through **A/B testing** and **experimentation**.

After years designing and developing digital products, I am now diving in the management aspects of them to empower other designers and developers in this process. I have already been collecting experiences with **product discovery and delivery**, **data analysis**, **roadmap definition**, **product vision and strategy**.
