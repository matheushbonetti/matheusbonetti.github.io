Since 2016 I have been working as a marketing designer for <a href="https://rdstation.com" target="_blank">RD Station</a> - brazilian biggest Digital Marketing SAAS Platform, offered by Resultados Digitais, the company I have been working on.

My job started with the mission to **develop a new brand identity to RD Station**, then **build and mantain it's website**, working closely with the Product Marketing team, **researching**, **planning**, **prototyping** and **implementing** new pages, sections and optimizations.

All of the website pages have been through several changes in the past few years, both for strategical or tactical reasons. The product pricing page, the most complex within the website, have been refactured by myself four times in the past 4 years. It is always a **complex UX and UI challenge** that involves a **deep dive into the company business, marketing strategy, user needs and behavior** - a tough but amazing journey with which I always learn a lot.

*You can see some of the prototyping, researching and testing work I have done in this process in the pictures below.*

Everything I created for RD Station branched into a countless number of campaigns, landing pages, ads, graphics, animations, business fair booths, product interface patterns, and it goes on. These deliverables have been often made by other designers, both within and outside my team. *You can see some of them below.*

## some milestones I am proud of

* The first website revamp, in 2016, completely changed it's experience and visual identity and marked a turning point in the way RD Station is marketed, with a more modern and professional approach.
* The 2017 version of the home page, designed to market RD Station new positioning as a platform, with integrations with third party solutions.
* The redesign of the website free trial flow, in a Hackathon with the product team in 2019, a project that granted my team the first place and a significant increase in trials and sales to the product.
* The last pricing page redesign, in 2020, built after the learnings of the previous version, several AB tests, interviews and usability tests with visitors and costumers.
