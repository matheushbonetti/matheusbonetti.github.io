In 2018, people at <a href="https://sajadv.com.br" target="_blank">SAJ ADV</a> - a Legal Software Company within <a href="https://softplan.com.br" target="_blank">SoftPlan</a> - asked me to **redesign their marketing website**. The project goals were to make it more visually modern and to **build a foundation for continuous optimization**, migrating the static website to a Wordpress structure.

The first step was to **redesign the conversion landing page**, a more simple task that allowed me to start with the new visual identity definitions, create the first styleguide elements and get used to the website infrastrucure I was going to work on. *Check the first version of this page below.*

After this first delivery, my next mission was the redesign of the product website. I tried my best to wrap all of <a href="/cases/rdstation">my experience with the RD Station website</a> and apply it in this project, so I decided to take action understanding the problem before trying to solve it. I did that through an **Analytics research** and **heuristic analysis**, that granted me a vision of how the users were behaving and what they were looking for on the website pages.

That insights evolved into the development and validation of **wireframes**, a **style guide**, and some documentation on possible next **conversion optimization experiments**.

*In the images below, you can see a glimpse of the heuristic and conceptual analysis I did in the previous website and the first version of the new home page wireframe.*

With better context, the next step was to apply the visual identity to the new wireframes and **develop the new website** - which also involved a lot of frontend design effort. The final result was a new website that delivered a fresh visual identity, a more robust code structure and an increase in conversion results.
